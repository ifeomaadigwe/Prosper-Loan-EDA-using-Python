# Prosper-Loan-EDA-using-Python
This repository was a Python Project I worked on

Conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset from Prosper, a leading marketplace lending platform in the United States that has funded over $9 billion in loans. The dataset contains information on 113,937 loans and 81 variables, including borrower rate, loan amount, current loan status, borrower income, employment status, credit history, and payment information. The primary objectives of this project were to analyze and summarize the key features that could impact the loan status and to explore the potential relationships among various variables through summary statistics and data visualization techniques.
